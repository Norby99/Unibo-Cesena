# DDD Exercises

## Exercise 1 -- Modelling the Simple Store

A simple domain keeping track of: _customers_, _products_, and _orders_.

### TO-DO

1. Read informal domain description
2. Identify the main domain concepts composing the ubiquitous language
3. Model the domain as Java types (classes or interfaces)
    - the model should include entities, value objects, repositories, factories, and services
4. Structure the Java types according to some module structure compliant with hexagonal architecture
    - i.e. put interfaces in either the `domain` or the `application` module
5. Sketch tests and, then, implementation for at least one
    - entity
    - value object 
    - factory
    - repository
    - value object

### Domain description

#### Customers

- Customers can either be companies or persons

- Companies are identified by a VAT number

- Persons are identified by tax codes

- In any case a name and email are recorded for each customer

- Both the name and email may vary over time

#### Products

- Products are identified by name and type/category

- They have a nominal price, expressed using some currency

- The availability of each product is tracked as well

- Both the price and the available quantity may vary over time

#### Money and exchange rates

- Money is represented by a decimal value and a currency

- Currencies are represented by a name, a symbol and an acronym
    - e.g. Euro, EUR, â‚¬
    - e.g. USA Dollar, USD, $

- Exchange rates keep track of the conversion rate
    + from a source currency
    + to a destination currency
    + in a particular moment

- Information about exchange rates can be attained from the Internet

- We can compute the price of each product, in any currency, at any moment

#### Orders

- Orders are identified by a serial number

- They keep track of the many products ordered by a customer
    * and the amount of copies ordered for each product

- Also, orders keep track of when they have been performed

- All such information may be modified before the order is delivered

- When a new order is registered, many actions should be performed in reaction

- It must be possible to compute the actual total price of an order
    * in a particular moment, using a particular currency

## Exercise 2 -- Trivial CQRS

A very simple repository: the `Counter`.
It contains 1 `long` number, initially set to 0.
The value may change arbitrarily.
Whenever the value changes, a new domain event is published, of type `Variation`.
However, the repository only memorise the _current_ value of the counter.

### TODO 

> 1. Switch the design towards __event sourcing__, by memorising variations instead of snapshots.
> 2. Implement the CQRS pattern

In practice:
1. provide implementations for the `CounterReader` and `CounterWriter` interfaces
2. optionally, test those implementations

## Exercise 3 -- Anti corruption layer

A very simple domain: `Table`s, i.e. 2-D containers of `Row`s, where each row contains one or more `String` values.
Functionalities for CSV import/export are missing and need to be implemented via third-party libraries.
At least two libraries are available:
- [Apache Commons CSV](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/)
    * Guide here: <https://www.baeldung.com/apache-commons-csv>
- [OpenCSV](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/)
    * Guide here: <https://www.baeldung.com/opencsv>

### TODO

1. Extend the model of our domain with new __interfaces__ supporting __CSV parsing / writing functionalities__
2. Design the interfaces so that they are __agnostic__ of the third-party libraries
    - without corrupting the domain model with library-specific types
3. Provide __implementations__ for the interfaces, using __one of the two__ libraries
4. Sketch __tests__ for the implementations
5. Provide __implementations__ for the interfaces, using __the other__ library
6. Use the same tests as above to prove the two implementations work the same way
